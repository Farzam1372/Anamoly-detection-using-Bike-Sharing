Bike sharing systems represent a modern evolution of traditional bike rentals, where the entire process (from membership to rental and return) has been automated. This innovation allows users to easily rent bikes from one location and conveniently return them at another. With over 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide, encompassing a staggering 500,000 bicycles, these systems have garnered significant attention due to their pivotal role in addressing traffic congestion, environmental concerns, and promoting public health.

The appeal of bike sharing systems extends beyond their practical applications. They offer a wealth of valuable data for research purposes. Unlike other modes of transport like buses or subways, bike sharing systems record precise details such as travel duration and specific departure and arrival positions. This unique attribute transforms these systems into virtual sensor networks that effectively capture mobility patterns across the city. As a result, these datasets hold the potential to detect and monitor crucial events and trends, contributing to the understanding of urban dynamics and fostering smarter city planning.

## Aim of project :  

- 1. Predicting Bike Rentals: Forecasting bike rental counts hourly or daily using environmental and seasonal factors.

- 2. Event Detection: Identifying anomalies and events using bike rental data correlated with external events, such as natural disasters or significant occurrences in the city.
